\ff{name} [options][command name][page]\f7

Options:
--system, -s   	\fdLists only the built-in system commands\f7
--user, -u     	\fdLists only the custom user commands\f7
--highlight, -h	\fdHighlights commands with no manual in red\f7

When called with no arguments, lists ALL available commands.
When called with the name of a command, lists usage
	info for that command if available
When given a page argument after a command name, shows that
	page of the command's manual. If no page is given, shows the
	first page. If the given page is 0, then the entire manual is
	shown, regardless of page breaks

See page 2 for info on adding manuals
---
To add a manual page for a user command:
a) Create a file named "\fa[command]_manual.txt\f7" alongside the command
b) Create a file named "\famanual.txt\f7" alongside the \fcmain.lua\f7 if
   the command is a .p64 file
c) Add a --[[multiline comment]] to the top of the command's code
	(in \fc[command].lua\f7 or \fcmain.lua\f7)

The utility will look for manual files in roughly that order.

Page breaks can be added to manuals by putting the string "---"
	on a line by itself (without the quotation marks). If the page break
	marker isn't on a line by itself, it'll be displayed normally.

Text colors can be added to manuals using p8scii (\ f0 to \ ff)
